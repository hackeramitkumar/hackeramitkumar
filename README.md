## ✨ About Me

I'm a **systems-focused software engineer** who enjoys building **high-performance, security-critical, and cloud-native systems**.

My work spans:
- **Low-level systems** (OS internals, kernel/user-space boundaries)
- **Distributed systems** and Kubernetes-native platforms
- **Security & policy enforcement** at scale
- **Open source infrastructure** in the CNCF ecosystem

I care deeply about **correctness, performance, and clean system design**, and I actively contribute to open source communities.
